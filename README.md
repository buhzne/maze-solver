# maze-solver

Maze Solver is an implementation of a deque (pronounced "deck") as an ADT for a double-ended queue and uses an array as 
an internal data structure. A deque is a linear ordered collection of elements that allows for adding and removing of 
elements from the front and back of the queue in constant (O(1)) time. Unlike a normal queue, which allows insertion 
only at the back and removal only from the front, a deque allows both at either end.

To see a demonstration of how a deque is used to solve a maze, download or clone the project files to a Java IDE, then run the
main.java file and enter a maze file name.
